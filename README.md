# 'Female Player test' (2023)
A mod for Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven (2002).

This is an experimental scene, originally made for Kardini, demonstrating the likely extent to which male and female player skeletons (and associated shadows) can co-exist in the game. The model *playerSARAH.4DS* contains a custom-named bone hierarchy, corresponding to custom objects added to the relevant shadow *.4DS* and *.6DS* models. Primary movement animations have also been modified to accomodate these changes, though a limit is reached in melee combat (some animations are bugged/do not 'connect' when intersecting another human's hitbox), and Sarah's arms are a slightly bugged when stepping/climbing up (maybe they're skinned slightly differently by default?). Superficial changes, such as player voice type and HUD, have also been made.

In addition, an extra 'hat bone' has been added to demonstrate the 'dynamic' potential of extra elements added to humans and their shadow models. Pressing OBJECTIVES (F1 by default) in-game will toggle Sarah's hat on/off, and her shadow will update to reflect the change. Changing player models can also be done on the fly with MAP (TAB by default), but Sarah's voice will remain and F1 hat functionality will break.
